## 🌟 Overview 

Welcome to the **Flux Energy Audit** backend engine! This robust API serves as the brain behind a comprehensive toolkit designed to help users understand, analyze, and optimize their energy consumption. By leveraging the power of **Google's Generative AI** and intelligent data processing, Flux turns confusing energy metrics into actionable, sustainable insights.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Insights**: Integrates with Google Generative AI to provide smart, contextual energy recommendations.
- 🔒 **Secure by Design**: Rock-solid authentication using JWT and bcrypt for safe user data management.
- 📊 **Dynamic Cost Estimation**: Flexible tariff calculation supporting both local slab tables and third-party APIs.
- 📖 **Interactive Documentation**: Beautifully auto-generated API docs via Swagger UI.
- ⚡ **Blazing Fast**: Built on the performant Express.js & MongoDB stack.

| **Documentation**| Swagger UI/JSDoc | Interactive API exploration. |

## 🚀 Launch Sequence (Getting Started)

Ready to power up? Follow these steps to get your local server running.

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- A running [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance (local or Atlas)

### 2️⃣ Installation
Clone the repository, blast into the `backend` directory, and install the modules:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Environment Variable Matrix
Create a `.env` file in your root backend directory to store your secrets safely. Here's your launch template:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000

# Database
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# Security
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key

# External APIs
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
```

### 4️⃣ Ignition (Running the App)

**🛠️ Development Mode** (Hot-reloading via nodemon)
```bash
npm run dev
```

**🚀 Production Mode**
```bash
npm start
```

## 🧪 Testing

The backend test suite uses **Jest** for unit tests, **Supertest** for route-level integration tests, and **Artillery** for performance testing.

### Run Unit and Integration Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Run Tests with Coverage

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Coverage Scope

Current backend coverage includes:

- User management controller tests
- Cost management controller tests
- Appliance management controller tests
- Energy audit controller tests
- API integration tests for major authenticated routes

### Run Performance Test

Start the backend first:

```bash
npm start
```

Then, in another terminal, run:

```bash
npm run test:performance
```

Artillery scenario file:

```text
tests/performance/costs-load.yml
```

## 🔋 Advanced: Cost Estimation with Tariff Sources

The `POST /api/costs/estimate` endpoint is engineered to handle dynamic pricing models. It gracefully supports multiple tariff sources:

- 🌍 **`external`**: Fetches live data from a third-party tariff API.
- 🏠 **`local`**: Falls back to the built-in, reliable local slab table.
- 🛡️ **`local_fallback`**: Automatically kicks in if the third-party API is unreachable.

#### Optional Environment variables for dynamic tariffs:
If you want to live on the edge and use a third-party API, add these to your `.env`:
```env
USE_TARIFF_API=true
TARIFF_API_URL=https://your-provider.example.com
TARIFF_API_KEY=your_api_key # (Optional, depending on provider)
```
